<div class="intro">
  <p>The city of Jacksonville is one of the largest in the country. It is home to diverse people with unique stories.</p>
  <p>The streets, buildings and bus stations can each give way to interesting stories if you lend an ear.</p>
  <p>These are stories of five people in Jacksonville who persevered in the face of adversity and now work tirelessly to be a beacon of light for others in their city.</p>
  <p>The following stories are of Bethany Baker, a deaf nurse; Valentino Dixon, a former wrongfully convicted felon; Alexus Torney, a 9-year-old with medical conditions that do not allow her to speak; Marlena Roberts, a homeless mother; and Latasha Hobbs, a leader in her local Moms Demand Action group.</p>

  <p>Their stories are waiting.</p>

<p id= "bethany-interview" class="interview-title">Listen to Bethany's story.</p>
<p class="interview-info" id="bethany-text">Bethany Baker would have laughed if someone told her years ago she would became a nurse. Even with a family full of nurses, she still wouldn't have believed it. Every person on her mom's side of the family is deaf in one ear, but she is the first fully deaf member of the family. She didn't imagine that career path for herself. Baker marked another first last summer. At 27, she became the first deaf person admitted to the University of North Florida's post-baccalaureate nursing program. "Right now in the health-care profession, there is not a lot of deaf people. Deaf people need to go get checkups too just like everyone else, but an issue is communication," Baker said.</p>

<p id="valentino-interview" class="interview-title">Listen to Valentino's story.</p>
<p class="interview-info" id="valentino-text">Over the 27 years Valentino Dixon spent in a prison in New York, his art was the only thing that kept him sane. He gave up drawing and art for the first seven years he spent behind bars. But after receiving a 38.5-years-to-life prison sentence for a crime he did not commit, he didn't dust his art supplies off again until 1998. Once he began to draw again, he drew for up to 10 hours each day of his sentence. He accumulated about 900 drawings in the 27-year-long sentence. His art has led him to be an advocate for prison and sentencing reform since his exoneration and release in September 2018. He started a nonprofit called the Art of Freedom Foundation this summer. "We need programs like the Art of Freedom inside every penitentiary. It helps to mold and shape people. It gives them options. It brings out talents that people sometimes would not necessarily even know that they have," he said.</p>

  <p id="alexus-interview" class="interview-title">Listen to Alexus's story.</p>
  <p class="interview-info" id="alexus-text">A voice that sounds much like what 9-year-old Alexus Torney's would broke the silence of her therapy session. Only it wasn't hers. She was born with cerebral palsy and primarily uses a program on her iPad, which she uses to speak. For the last two years, she has worked with her speech therapist at Wolfson Children's Hospital to learn how to talk using toys. Her eyes lit up as she played with a pink and white dollhouse. She tapped the screen after spending a minute searching for the word she wanted. "Girl," the automated, childlike voice said through the machine. Through her speech therapy sessions at the hospital, doctors have seen her communication skills improve.</p>

<p id="marlena-interview" class="interview-title">Listen to Marlena's story.</p>
<p class="interview-info" id="marlena-text">Marlena Roberts sits at the downtown Jacksonville bus station. The screeching of brakes and chattering of passengers on phones surround her and her children who sit on the bench. As a homeless mother who lives in a shelter downtown, a typical day for her revolves around the bus. When the city began to discuss bus fare increases, she shared her story about how she would struggle if they went up by even 50 cents. She spends almost three hours each day on the public buses. Fare increases, even small ones, would mean small increases multiple times a day, seven days a week.</p>

    <p id="latasha-interview" class="interview-title">Listen to Latasha's story.</p>
    <p class="interview-info" id="latasha-text">On a mid-summer afternoon, Latasha Hobbs strolled into a downtown coffee shop wearing her bright orange t-shirt. She came prepared with a stack of flyers with her son's photo on them. He was shot in Jacksonville as she was on her way to pick him up. She made a wrong turn on the block, and when she drove back around he was gone. She now lives her life as an advocate for common sense gun legislation and participates in the local Mom's Demand Action events. Her son's murder is still unsolved nearly three years later. She likes to say she is living for him, and she plans to work until more gun-related crimes are solved and other mothers like her in Jacksonville have peace.</p>
